<h1>Understanding Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        When analyzing algorithms, one crucial aspect to consider is their <em>Time complexity</em>.
        Time complexity measures the efficient of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to
        run as the input size grows. An algorithm is considered efficient when it can handle larger inputs
        without a significant increase in execution time. Developers strive to create algorithms with lower
        time complexity, ensuring optimal performance for various tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another critical factor in algorithm analysis is <strong>Space Complexity</strong>.
        Space complexity evaluates the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem
        based on the input size. It's represented using Big O notation, like <strong>O(n)</strong>,
        where 'n' is the size of the input. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize their space complexity,
        allowing them to handle larger inputs without consuming excessive memory.
